This is an app to play around with dependency injection with NextJS, the primary focus will be on using [tsyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe) to interact with [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and [DAPI](https://digimon-api.com/) but may expand further to use more services or different DI libraries/frameworks.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
